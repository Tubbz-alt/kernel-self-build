# kernel-self-build
My self-built kernel which is not provided by Slackware official repo.   

It is customized and enabled AppArmor.

**Note0:** This SlackBuild produces kernel image and its modules as one package, and kernel source as another package.  

**Note1:** the kernel-modules SlackBuild is just a meta-package as a placeholder. The kernel modules were to be installed along with the kernel.SlackBuild altogether.

**Note2:** Although the kernel built by kernel.SlackBuild will be named as **generic** (just to suit to Slackware live), it is up to you to decide what kind of kernel you want to build (just remember to change $SRC).
